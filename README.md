# coeus


Coeus is a Learning Management System with a workflow based on the best learning science knowledge available. It has a fastAPI-based backend and will guide the student through the content in an orchestrated method to maximize learning depth and speed. Learning is tested regularly to induce the use of active recall and active learning based on the mistakes on the tests. Spaced repetition is automatically handleded upon login, and the student is handheld the whole way through learning. Still in construction.
